        "A new dialect mixing french and english is forming and will gain global dominance over standalone-english. This is due to migration and geopolitical trends. French and english are both predomantly required for employment at NATO, demonstrating its continued importance in global diplomacy in the west. Quebec impliments laws to protect the french language, even requiring business employees at restaurants and other establishments to speak it and making anglo signage illegal. The preservation of the french language is also seen in france as an unspoken rule in social customs. Many french companies prefer doing business with other french companies, and speaking french to conduct business. France is an economic and military super-power. It is highly resistant to far-right leadership, making it a true democracy even as other nations in Europe see a rise in far right leadership. For example, Presidential candidate LePen, was banned from office, while other countries do not take such actions on the far right. The far right rise in a country leads to geopolitical and trade tensions. Countries prefer doing trade with countries that are more friendly to outside trade partnerships, and less nationalistic. In 2013, Natixis, a french investment bank produced a study based on migration data from french-speaking countries in africa. They held that by 2050, french would take global dominance. They used a pro forma style analysis as a proxy to analze this data. Now, in 2025, we have better tools and it is my holding that their research misses the nuances of geopolitical shifts that are at the core of language shifts over the centuries. In this model, we ask, \"what were the shifts that led to latin declining, and english taking over as the global language? How did french lose domiance in the 1700s?\" Then we try to quantify these nuanced trends using a rubric system factoring in governance, corruption, democracy, political effectiveness, stability, among other qualitiative variables. We also look to unstructured data. Franglais is known as a dialect in real life and in meme culture. It is the mixture of french and english.\n",

        "Natixis Methodology: It is in my professional opinion that utilizing traditional financial models such as EBIT based on the idea of PE investment is a bit archaic. The study was published in 2013. We have better tools at our disposal in 2025 to process this data and make predictions. It is also flawed because it requires proxying a model not meant to be used for statistical observation such as a DCF to predict language trends. However, the method utilizing migration from francophonic african countries seems to have viability and was utilized in combination with historic geopolitical and economic shifts and trends that may suggest that french will be the most spoken language by 2050. Here, we test this and we add an indicator for geopolitical risk such as war, gdp groth and loss, as well as the growth of the far right globally and resistance to this growth in certain countries vs. others. This is based on the idea that as we saw in Germany, such shifts to totalitarian, or fascist idealogies are bad for economic prosperity and dampen diplomatic relations.\n",

        "Remarks from the Natixis study:\n",
        "- The strong demographic growth in French-speaking regions (notably in Africa) offers long-term growth potential far greater than what the market is currently pricing in. Indeed, the digitalization of content removes geographical boundaries while reinforcing linguistic boundaries. In other words, if French becomes the most widely spoken language in the world by 2050, French media content groups could address a global-scale market, with potential growth three times higher than their current reference market (the domestic French market).\n",
        "\n",
        "- French, the most widely spoken language in the world in 2050: According to a study by the OIF (Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie), the number of French speakers worldwide is expected to rise from 220 million in 2012 to around 750 million in 2050, about 90% of whom will be in Africa—a continent whose economic growth is also expected to be particularly strong. French could therefore become the most widely spoken language in the world, ahead of English. While 8% of the global population currently speaks English, this figure is expected to fall to 5% in 2050. Conversely, French is expected to be spoken by 8% of the population, compared with 3% in 2012."

First, it builds a table with key French-language statistics inspired by OIF figures (such as about 321 million global French speakers). Then it creates a short list of Francophone countries. Next, it constructs sample development data for several countries—population, GDP, education spending, and school enrollment—mimicking what you would normally get from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. It also creates a similar sample dataset of governance scores modeled on the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, using values on the typical –2.5 to +2.5 scale. Finally, the code prints the size of each dataset to confirm they were created correctly."

        "In this project, the dataset encodes historical and scenario-based geopolitical indicators into a structured numeric format (CSV). Each row corresponds to a time point (100 CE, 1750, 1950, 2020, and 2070), and each column represents a dimension of international power that influences language dominance. For example, state reach measures how much territory and population are unified under one political system, while military projection captures the ability to project power beyond borders. Trade centrality reflects whether the hegemon is positioned at the center of major trade routes, and monetary influence measures how widely its currency is accepted for trade and reserves. Market depth goes a step further: it refers to the size and liquidity of a hegemon’s financial markets and their ability to set global prices and provide capital — for instance, the New York Stock Exchange today or Rome’s role in Mediterranean grain financing. Ideology hegemony measures how much the leading state’s worldview (e.g., Roman law, Enlightenment values, American liberal capitalism) dominates international norms, while language prestige (separately tracked for Latin, French, and English) captures how much each language is used in diplomacy, finance, and culture. Emerging market weight measures how economically significant rising regions are (e.g., Egypt in Roman times, Africa in the future), and emerging market language adoption records how much these regions adopt the hegemon’s language for administration, trade, and education. Finally, emerging market financial linkages assess whether these regions are plugged into the hegemon’s financial hubs or operate in isolation."

        "In plain language:\n",
        "\n",
        "By 2050, roughly one in three Francophones may use “Franglais” elements — English words, syntax, or mixed code-switching — in everyday communication (especially in informal and digital contexts).\n",
        "\n",
        "🧮 Why It’s 35.9 % (not 70 %)\n",
        "\n",
        "Your synergy factor (0.47) and diffusion rate (α = 0.08) create a moderate growth curve — hybrid usage grows, but it doesn’t fully take over.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you increased the synergy (say, to 0.6–0.7) — reflecting stronger global media integration or even more AI bilingualism — you’d likely see 2050 levels closer to 50–70 %.\n",

        "2050 Projection (35.9 %)\tExpected adoption by mid-century\tWidespread hybridization, but not dominance\n",
        "🔍 How to Adjust\n",
        "\n",
        "If you believe:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pop-culture and tech will intertwine even more strongly → increase E, M, T to 4.5 each → synergy ≈ 0.65 → 2050 ≈ 60 %.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cultural protectionism (France limiting Anglicisms) slows adoption → reduce E, M → synergy ≈ 0.3 → 2050 ≈ 25 %. By 2050, your model predicts that hybrid French–English speech (Franglais-type) could account for about 35–40 % of informal linguistic usage in the Francophone world — a significant cultural shift, but still alongside standard French and English."

A Hadamard gate (H) on an initial state |0⟩ creates an equal superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩ – meaning the qubit will collapse to 0 or 1 upon measurement with 50% probability each\n",

        "Connecting Quantum Superposition to Language Dominance Modeling\n",
        "This simple quantum experiment provides insight into probabilistic modeling for language dominance predictions. Key parallels between the quantum superposition framework and geopolitical language scenarios include:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Superposition of Outcomes: A qubit in superposition can represent multiple possible states at once. Likewise, our model can hold multiple language dominance outcomes simultaneously (e.g. English vs. French vs. a hybrid scenario) instead of committing to one deterministically. Quantum cognition research suggests that decision scenarios can indeed be represented as overlapping possibilities (superposed states)researchgate.net.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Probabilistic Predictions: In quantum mechanics, the state’s amplitudes define the probability of each outcome upon measurement. Similarly, we assign probabilities to each language dominance scenario. The equal superposition in the demo gave each outcome ~50% chance, analogous to a situation where two futures are equally likely. In practice, our model might predict, for example, a 70% chance of English dominance vs. 30% chance of French – these percentages play the role of quantum state probabilities, capturing uncertainty rather than a single fixed forecast.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Measurement as Outcome Realization: Measuring the qubit forces it into one definite state (either 0 or 1). This parallels how, as we reach the year of prediction (say 2050), one particular outcome will “collapse” into reality – e.g. either English or French ends up dominant. Until that point, we treat each possibility as viable. The quantum model thus naturally mirrors the idea that multiple futures can exist in theory, but only one will materialize.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Geopolitical Variability and Uncertainty: Quantum frameworks embrace inherent uncertainty and randomness, which is crucial given geopolitical volatility. Each run of the quantum circuit can yield a different sequence of 0/1 outcomes, just as real-world events (wars, policies, technological shifts) can tip the balance toward one language or another unexpectedly. A quantum-influenced model can dynamically adjust the “state” probabilities as conditions change, reflecting how quantum systems capture complex, non-linear influencesresearchgate.net. In other words, much like our qubit needed many runs to map out its probability distribution, we might use a quantum approach to simulate numerous what-if scenarios, building a probabilistic picture of language dominance rather than a single prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "By integrating this Hadamard superposition demo into the notebook, we highlight that our language dominance model isn’t just about point estimates – it’s about a distribution of possibilities. The quantum perspective provides a powerful analogy (and potential computational frameworkresearchgate.net) for modeling uncertainty in global linguistic trends, ensuring that our predictions account for the inherent unpredictability of socio-economic and geopolitical factors.Sources"

The circuit is executed 1024 times on Qiskit’s AerSimulator to gather statistics, and the resulting counts of 0s and 1s are printed and plotted as a histogram. The output illustrates the fundamental quantum property that measurements do not produce a single deterministic result but instead follow a probability distribution determined by the quantum state."

        "Why Quantum rather than a Neural Network?\n",
        "It can offer advantages in specific situations because it processes information in fundamentally different ways. A neural network learns patterns using classical arithmetic operations, while a quantum circuit represents data using quantum states that can exist in superposition and become entangled. This allows quantum models to explore extremely high-dimensional feature spaces using only a small number of qubits, potentially capturing complex correlations that classical models would need many more parameters to represent. In problems where patterns depend on subtle interference effects or highly nonlinear relationships, a quantum circuit can in principle encode and transform data in ways that classical networks cannot reproduce efficiently. However, quantum models also tend to be harder to train, more sensitive to noise, and not yet consistently superior in real-world tasks. So the advantage isn’t that they “predict better” universally, but that they can sometimes learn richer transformations from fewer parameters by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement—properties no classical neural network can emulate directly."
